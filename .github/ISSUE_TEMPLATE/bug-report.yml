        Share with a code snippet or a GitHub repo to reproduce the issue.
      placeholder: |
        Please share the code script to reproduce the issue. If more than one file is needed,
        create a GitHub repository and share the link.
        This will be automatically formatted into code, so no need for backticks.
        Be sure to include an SSCCE (Short, Self Contained, Correct
        [compilable] example) http://sscce.org/
        Issues without a reproduction script are likely to stall and eventually be closed.
